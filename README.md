Diabetes Prediction

This project predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical and health-related data.
It uses Machine Learning techniques to analyze the dataset and make predictions.

ðŸ“Œ Features

Data Preprocessing â€” Handles missing values, scaling, and feature selection.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€” Visualizations to understand the dataset.

Model Training â€” Uses algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.

Model Evaluation â€” Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report.

Prediction â€” Takes input features and predicts diabetes likelihood
